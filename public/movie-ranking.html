<<h1>Things that I enjoyed this year by Devan!</h1>
<h2>My top three pieces of media from this year</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Five nights at freddies</h3>
<p>While the film seemed to be written mostly for children, it showed promise with the themes it presented. The potential of it becoming a series is extremely high.</p>
<h3>Lilo and Stitch</h3>
<p>A childhood classic makes all of the rougher times in life much easier to on your palette.</p>
<h3>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</h3>
<p>While slightly cheating with this it is a visual novel game which is similar to a movie. It showcases the life of an amnesiac detective who has to rediscover his purpose, memories and protect his new friends from a looming threat.</p>
